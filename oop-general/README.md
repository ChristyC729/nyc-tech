# Note:

The specifications were quite broad in the sense that which engine behaviors would be directly invoked by the driver or which engine behaviors trigger which other engine behaviors, assumptions had to be made.

For this OOP Design, since it states that "All cars have 1 engine and 1 driver", each folder has it's own interpretations of the car structure and how each class should be initialized.
The specifications were as follows:

**Write a program to simulate the following scenario:**
* All cars have 1 engine and 1 driver
* A car engine can perform operations such as:
    * Ignite
    * Accelerate
    * Burn Fuel
    * Turn Belts
    * Shift Gears
* Some engine behaviors can be invoked directly by the driver, while others cannot
* Some engine behaviors trigger other engine behaviors
* All cars maintain a record of their own speed and direction

Use OOP Designs to make needed classes with methods to meet those requirements. You can use any language or pseudo-code to write down your results.
