# Method_One

This folder is a simple implementation of the requirements.

This structure makes the assumptions that 'Car' is the parent class with Engine and Driver as an instance in Car. Then the public methods in 'Engine' are accesible to the driver (which I'm assuming is the user) and the private methods are not. This means that the method calls in Cars are called by "the driver".
